<p class="Heading">Savage Beeper Engine</p>
<p class="BodyText">This engine provides two tone channels and one drum channel 
with a total of five percussion sounds. The tone channels have a variety of 
effects available: Glissando, skew, XOR, ornamentation (arpeggios) and an FX 
tone generator for generating additional sound effects when combined with the 
other effects settings.</p>
		<p class="BodyText">Special thanks are due to
		<a href="http://speccy.info/Barmaley_m">Barmaley_M</a> for doing the 
		painstaking work of reverse engineering this complex engine, and to
		<a href="http://shiru.untergrund.net/1bit">Shiru</a> for translating his 
		work to English so that I could make use of it in Beepola.</p>
	<p class="BodyText"><strong>Effects<br />
	</strong>All of the effects can be applied to both channel 1 and channel 2 
	as required, however there are some interactions between the channels when 
	effects are applied to both channels simultaneously, or more than one effect 
	is applied to a channel at one time. Values for each effect are entered in 
	hexadecimal (00 to FF) in the appropriate editor column, with a value of 00 
	turning the effect off. The &quot;FX&quot; column is boolean and speficies whether the 
	sound effect generator should be on or off for the selected row.</p>
	<p class="BodyText"><strong>Glissando Effect</strong><br />
	Glissando causes the pitch of a note to slide downwards at the specified 
	rate. The main limitation of this effect is that it will automatically stop 
	when a new note appears<em> on either channel.</em> If glissando and 
	ornamentation are combined on a single row, the glissando effect is only 
	applied to the first note of the arpeggio.</p>
	<p class="BodyText">One interesting use of this effect is to create &quot;falling 
	pitch&quot; drum sounds, using a high glissando value such as FF, together with a 
	high pitch note in the top octave, perhaps also coupled with a skew effect. 
	Because these effects appear in a tone channel, that can be used alongside 
	other percussion effects in the drum channel.</p>
	<p class="BodyText"><strong>Skew and Skew XOR Effects<br />
	</strong>Skew affects the timbe of all subsequent notes in the channel by 
	skewing the frequency of one of the two tone generators for the channel, 
	to&nbsp;produce a more complex waveform. The XOR column has a value that is XORed 
	with the skew parameter on every row, and this result becoming the new skew 
	value for that row.</p>
	<p class="BodyText">The skew and xor columns can be used freely in either 
	channel without affecting the timbre of the notes in the other channel, and 
	can be used with either glissandi or ornamentation effects without any 
	adverse effects. </p>
	<p class="BodyText">Skew and xor values of 00 produce a simple square-wave 
	tone.</p>
	<p class="BodyText"><strong>Ornament Effect<br />
	</strong>The ornamentation column allows one of up to 31 user-defined 
	arpeggios to be selected for the current, and all subsequent, notes in the 
	channel. Ornaments are defined in the ornament editor as a sequence of 
	offsets (in semitones) from the root note, and a single ornament may contain 
	up to 255 offset values. However, the <em>total</em> number of offsets 
	defined across all ornaments used in a song must also not exceed 255. So you 
	could have 31 ornaments of 8 notes or fewer, but only 4 ornaments of 64 
	notes in length, or 1 of 255 notes in length.</p>
	<p class="BodyText">Ornament notes are played at duty cycle of 50Hz. An 
	ornament value of 00 specifies &quot;ornament off&quot; or &quot;no ornament&quot;.</p>
	<p class="BodyText">The use of ornaments on one channel has a fairly 
	profound effect on the sound of notes in the other channel, creating a 50Hz 
	buzz on the second channel if no ornament. Different ornaments can be used 
	on each channel simultaneously, which can sometimes mask the 50Hz buzz.</p>
	<p class="BodyText">Ornaments and glissandi don&#39;t really work together, 
	since the ornament is disabled as soon as the second note of the ornament is 
	played (regardless of whether the ornament is on the same channel as the 
	glissando or not).</p>
		<p class="BodyText"><strong>FX Column<br />
		</strong>The FX column is boolean - it can be either on or off for a 
		given row. Switching the FX generator on has a dramatic effect for the 
		note on which it occurs, which can be used along with the other effects 
		columns to generate a range of synthesised drum effects, and various 
		siren/whistle/phaser-type effects. The FX generator behaves differently for each 
		of the 2 channels, and the channel with FX set to &quot;On&quot; can have its sound modified 
		considerably by whatever sound is being generated on the other channel.</p>
	<p class="BodyText">&nbsp;Some 
		examples of the many effects that can be generated are:-<br />

	</strong>A song may contain up to 127 unique patterns, and each 
	pattern may contain up to 126 notes per channel. The tempo and length of 
	each pattern may be set individually.</p>
	<p class="BodyText">The lowest valid note value is C-1 and the highest is 
	B-5. <em>However</em> the bottom three notes of octave 1 are significantly 
	detuned (more than a semitone each) - this is how the frequency table from 
	the original engine was laid out, and it has been decided to preserve the 
	sound of the original engine fully by keeping these 
	values. No other significant detuning appears to be present.</p>
